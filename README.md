# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE**.

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- Pickle

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
A small sample dataset of news headlines and articles with labels:
- **REAL** â†’ Legitimate news
- **FAKE** â†’ Misinformation

## ðŸ›  Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing (label mapping, cleaning)
2. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
3. Training Logistic Regression Model
4. Model Evaluation using accuracy & confusion matrix
5. Model Deployment using Pickle

## ðŸš€ How to Run:
1. Load the dataset (`fake_or_real_news.csv`)
2. Train model and save as `logistic_model.pkl`
3. Use `predict_news(text)` function to classify new text

## ðŸ“ˆ Results:
- Achieved high accuracy on the test set
- Model is able to distinguish between FAKE and REAL news articles

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements:
- Larger, real-world dataset
- More advanced NLP techniques (BERT, transformers)
- Web application for public use
